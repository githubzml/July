# The Free Stuff Room

&emsp;&emsp;My name is A.J and I hate school.

&emsp;&emsp;There's only one room in Ella Mentry School that I really like. It's the lost and found room!

&emsp;&emsp;The lost and found room is right near the office. It is coolest room in the history of the world because there is losts of free stuff in there.Me and my friends Michael and Ryan call it "the free stuff room." You can get just about anything you want,and you don't event have to pay for it.So if I feel like getting a new baseball cap or pair of sun-glasses, I don't have to go to a store.I just go to the free stuff room at school. It's awesome!

&emsp;&emsp;So this one morning the bus got to school a little early,and I want to kill some time in the free stuff room.I saw a really cool black T-shirt with a lighting bolt across the back.It was way cooler than the shirt I was wearing.So I took my shirt off and put the cool one on.It fit perfectly.I stuffed my old,boring shirt in my backpack.

&emsp;&emsp;It was almost time to pledge the alle-glance.So I went to class.The kids were putting their backpacks and lunch boxes in their cubbies.
